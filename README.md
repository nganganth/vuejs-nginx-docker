# vuejs-nginx-docker
In this project, I am going to use Vue.js as a JS library, NGINX as a web server and docker as a container runtime
Install node.js to use npm command

Install Vue VLI via npm 
npm install --global vue-cli
or 
npm install -g @vue/cli@latest
Check Vue version to make sure the installation was successful
vue --version
